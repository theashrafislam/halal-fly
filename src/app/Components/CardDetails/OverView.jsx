            <p className='text-[#444]'>An Umrah tour covering both Makkah and Madinah offers a deeply spiritual journey for Muslims. The pilgrimage begins in Makkah, where pilgrims perform the Umrah rituals—Tawaf around the Kaaba, Sa’i between Safa and Marwah, and trimming or shaving the hair. Alongside the rituals, pilgrims visit sacred sites like Jabal al-Noor, the Zamzam Well, and Maqam Ibrahim. Accommodation is typically close to Masjid al-Haram, and tours are guided by scholars or experienced coordinators.

                After completing Umrah, the journey continues to Madinah, where pilgrims spend time at Masjid al-Nabawi, the resting place of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Visitors often pray in Rawdah, explore historical sites such as Quba Mosque, Uhud Mountain, and the Qiblatain Mosque. The tour includes hotel stays, transport between cities, and often meals and group lectures, making it a well-rounded spiritual and educational experience.
